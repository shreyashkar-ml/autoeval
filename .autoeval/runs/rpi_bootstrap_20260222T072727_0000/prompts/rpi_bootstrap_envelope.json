Each `sub_task` must contain:\n   - `id`\n   - `phase_id` (stable link to a phase in `plan.md`)\n   - `phase`\n   - `sub_task_description` (smallest independently testable unit)\n   - `criteria` (array of objective pass checks)\n   - `status` (boolean)\n2. Order `sub_tasks` by phase order in `plan.md`, then by execution order within each phase.\n3. Agents may only mutate `status`. All other fields are immutable.\n4. Completion is valid only when evidence satisfies every criterion.\n5. Use rebaseline workflow for criteria changes; do not edit in place.\n6. Do not store planning prose in this artifact.\n7. Criteria must be objectively verifiable (tests, commands, outputs, or concrete observable behavior).\n8. Every `sub_task` must map cleanly to a specific phase boundary from `plan.md`.\n\n## JSON Shape\n```json\n{\n  \"schema_version\": 1,\n    \"template\": {\n      \"id\": \"rpi_feature_list\",\n      \"version\": \"2.2.0\"\n    },\n  \"generated_at\": \"ISO-8601\",\n  \"sub_tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"phase_1_subtask_1\",\n      \"phase_id\": \"phase_1\",\n      \"phase\": \"Phase 1 - <name>\",\n      \"sub_task_description\": \"<smallest testable implementation unit>\",\n      \"criteria\": [\n        \"<objective pass check 1>\",\n        \"<objective pass check 2>\"\n      ],\n      \"status\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n",

Phase breakdown with explicit boundaries (what is in scope/out of scope per phase).\n2. Phase objective, dependency assumptions, and expected output per phase.\n3. Testing methodology for each phase (unit/integration/e2e/manual checks).\n4. Strict constraints for each phase (allowed tools, runtime boundaries, no-go edits, safety constraints).\n5. Planned file/script touchpoints for each phase (exact paths, purpose of edits, why phase owns them).\n6. Skeletal implementation snippets for non-trivial edits (pseudocode/diff-style outline, not full implementation).\n7. Relevant code references or excerpts that justify the planned approach.\n8. Phase exit criteria and blocker handling.\n9. Risk/rollback notes and handoff instructions for context rollover.\n\n## Execution Contract\n- The orchestrator decides completion based on evidence, not agent claims.\n- Do not put smallest granular sub-task definitions in this file.\n- Granular implementation units and pass criteria belong only in `feature_list.json`.\n- Every phase in plan should map to one or more `sub_tasks` in `feature_list.json`.\n\n## Phase Template\n### Phase <N> - <name>\n- Objective:\n- In scope:\n- Out of scope:\n- Dependencies/assumptions:\n- Strict constraints:\n- Planned file/script touchpoints:\n- Skeletal change snippet(s):\n- Relevant code references:\n- Validation:\n- Exit criteria:\n",
      "research": "<!-- template_id: rpi_research -->\n<!-- template_version: 2.2.0 -->\n\n# Research Artifact Instruction\n\nPurpose:\n- Build repository familiarity context for a target repository when `autoeval` is initialized there for the first time.\n- This artifact is repository-level and not task-specific.\n- It should remain reusable across future tasks in the same target repository.\n\n## Scope Rules\n1. Cover the whole repository architecture and behavior baseline, not just a single request.\n2. Keep this artifact factual and descriptive; do not include phase execution status.\n3. After implementation runs, update this file surgically so it reflects current functionality.\n4. Preserve historical context; do not rewrite the entire document each run unless structure is obsolete.\n5. Build structure sections from direct repository inspection by the worker agent; do not rely on pre-generated tree snapshots.\n6. While preparing structure highlights, follow the repository `.gitignore` rules; include ignored paths only when they are directly relevant to the request.\n\n## Required Sections\n1. Repository tree/map with one-line descriptions for important nodes and modules.\n2. Project directory and script structures with a one-line purpose/functionality note for each highlighted entry.\n3. Core functionality and module responsibilities.\n4. End-to-end flow traces for key user/system paths.\n5. Integration methodology and external dependencies (APIs, services, data stores, queues).\n6. Deployment/runtime/testing setup (entry points, commands, tooling assumptions).\n7. Known gaps, risks, and unknowns with evidence needed to resolve them.\n\n## Update Rules\n- Keep links/file references actionable and current.\n- If behavior changes, update only affected sections with concrete diffs in understanding.\n- Do not add per-phase checklists or granular sub-task completion states here.\n"
