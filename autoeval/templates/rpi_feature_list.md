# Feature List Artifact Instruction

Purpose:
- Break down each phase as described in `plan.md` into multiple sub-tasks each with independently verifiable passing criteria for success.
- Represent phase-to-sub-task mapping where each plan phase can contain multiple sub-tasks.

## Rules
1. Each `sub_task` must contain:
   - `id`
   - `phase_id` (stable link to a phase in `plan.md`)
   - `sub_task_description` (smallest independently testable unit)
   - `criteria` (array of objective pass checks)
   - `status` (boolean)
2. Order `sub_tasks` by phase order in `plan.md`, then by execution order within each phase.
3. Agents CAN only mutate `status`. All other fields are immutable.
4. Completion is valid only when evidence satisfies every criterion.
5. Use rebaseline workflow for criteria changes; do not edit in place.
6. Do not store planning prose in this artifact.
7. Criteria must be objectively verifiable (tests, commands, outputs, or concrete observable behavior).
8. Every `sub_task` must map cleanly to a specific phase boundary from `plan.md`.
